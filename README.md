# 2134-Civility-Optics
Civility Optics is a mobile application for rating the social civility of businesses and public venues. The 
platform provides access to ratings that commend businesses with fair social treatment and ratings that hold 
businesses accountable for unfair social treatment. 
The native application interfaces with the backend to authenticate user 
activity, provide civility information about local venues, and collect civility ratings for venues. The backend 
will integrate an authentication service for managing user accounts, connect to the Google Places API to find 
local businesses, and host a database for logging userâ€™s ratings.
